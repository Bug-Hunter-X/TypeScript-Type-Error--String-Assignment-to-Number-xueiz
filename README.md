# TypeScript Type Error: String Assignment to Number

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript type error and its solution.  The `add` function expects two numbers, but the example code passes a string as the second argument, resulting in a type error.

The solution involves using type guards or input validation to ensure the correct types are passed to the function.
